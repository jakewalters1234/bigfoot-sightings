"1","It was the winter of 1996 and we were on our way home from church one Sunday evening. It wasn't dark yet. As we came around a corner we watched what we believe to be a bigfoot cross the road. As it came to a barb wired fence it stepped over it without missing a beat. It was like the fence wasn't even there. The fences in this area range from 3 1/2 feet to 4 foot tall. It was tall, dark in color and walked up right. There have been other sightings because our river bottoms were turned into a major lake project. Years ago I had heard the scream of the bigfoot which is something you don't forget.","Hwy 182, Wood County Between Quitman, Texas and Alba, Texas","Wood County","Texas","Winter","Report 2048: Night time road crossing observation",32.7943,-95.5425,"12/22/1996",2048,"Class A","9vu49fh0dk",75.3,71.4,68.1,58.6,64.7,52.9,0.43,NA,0,NA,NA,"Partly cloudy throughout the day.","Partially cloudy",NA,10.5,180.4,20.8,120
"2","I would like to share with you what I saw as a boy. I saw a Bigfoot standing over our burn barrel. I remember being very young when this happened. But I have never forgot what I saw. It was strong and tall but not real tall.  Maybe six foot ten to seven feet tall. It had a smell to him I will never forget. I knew he was still there down in the hollow where I was raised as a child. When we would cut firewood in the saw mill he would make us feel weird like he didn't want us there. My mom would say start the truck and don't stop until we get to the top of the ridge. We found footprints one winter that were very wide at the heel and very large in size like 17-20 inches long. I hope someone hears what I have to say. I would love to talk to someone about this. I know he is still there! It's a perfect place for him to live with so much forest and hills.","Between Whipple and Lower Salem, Ohio.","Washington County","Ohio","Winter","Report 7220: A man relates a series of occurrences on the family farm involving an upright walking hair covered creature",39.54739,-81.39101,"11/1/1978",7220,"Class A","dpn0gzkuhp",61.4,49.4,41.4,43.7,81.8,27.5,0.03,0,0,NA,1025.4,"Partly cloudy throughout the day.","Partially cloudy",NA,4.7,11.9,8.5,181

"5","I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot. After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road, I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit.","From I-95 S, merge onto RI-4 S toward North Kingstown.

At that time, there were large bushes growing on the east side of the pond. I travel that road a lot and it became habit to glance down at the pond to look for deer.

I was checking to see if the deer had been eating the cracked corn I left them.  Most of the corn had been eaten. I turned around to look back towards my truck and next to the gas well road was a large tree that was about 30 feet off the road. Next to the tree was a very tall, wide shouldered, very built, dark brown, hairy creature standing next to it.  The creature had pushed a fairly large branch away from its face so that he could watch us.  All I could do was stand there for a few seconds which seemed like hours staring back at the creature.

My uncle which does not believe in anything unless he sees it went out one night in April to sit up in a deer stand to watch the deer that travel trough the fields behind his house. My uncle came running in the house and he was as white as a ghost. He said, ""I just seen a Bigfoot."" He said that when he was looking at the creature the creature looked right back at him as if he was scared of my uncle and not sure of what my uncle (being in the tree) was. My uncle said that the creature was about eight feet tall and when it walked it too huge steps. It would have taken my uncle four steps of his own to equal one of the creatures. When the creature looked at him he swayed back and fourth moving the top half of his body as his hands were placed on his knees.","Off of State Route 7 (the rest omitted).","Columbiana County","Ohio","Fall","Report 6900: Ongoing accounts with a screaming ape-like creature",40.77972,-80.64831,"11/1/2001",6900,"Class A","dpnxuz9xn4",68.1,59.4,48.9,40.3,49.6,87.5,0.5,0,0,NA,1021.7,"Partly cloudy throughout the day.","Partially cloudy",NA,9.8,195.3,18.2,199

"268","Late at night, in or about July, 1975, I heard a large noise in the woods in front of our house. Although it was dark it was a clear night and quite warm. I looked down into the woods and saw two very large red eyes staring back at me, at first I thought it was a deer but I realized that they were too high up, and I heard what sounded like long slow breaths. I went in and got a flashlight and shined it down there but whatever it was had gone. In the morning I went down to the spot and found no discernable prints but the ground had been heavily trampled. It should be noted that there are many abandoned coke ovens within a quarter mile of here and a fresh running stream right below them.

However, this thing stood erect the whole time, maybe 10 minutes. Joe and I kidded that we saw Big Foot but the more we think about it the more we don't think it was a bear.

When we got there and got out of the car you could hear a noise that sounded kind of like a monkey noise....ooh ooh ooh....it was repetative and I didnt think anything of it at first. So we hike up the hill side to where the noise is coming from and where the pond is, and we discovered a foot print while the whole time still hearing this noise, ooh ooh ooh, short and sharp but monkey like. At one point we felt as if it ran right up behind us as if to scare us but we didnt hear any brush crashing or anything but the noise got closer and you could actually like hear it in the back of his throat. Nothing real exciting or more than circumstantial but when we returned again a few months later the noise was not there.","Hwy 7 past Ashford, take a right before you see a sign for the national park.

It seemed to come from the edge of the partial clearing I was in, perhaps 75 to 100 yards.

It came from a height, and my first thought was an owl in large tree about 25 yards away, but it didn't sound avian at all.  It sounded strangely feminine for some reason.

The screams only went on for a minute or so, but what surprised me was that my father, who has lived in Stevenson his entire life and knows the woods and the local animals well, did not have any idea what was making that sound.  I was 17 at the time, but just recently, my teen age daughter, who has an interest in such matters, played me the 1978 Snohomish County recording of Bigfoot calls, and I have to admit I got a chill from hearing it, because it was, to my recollection, just what I heard on that summer night in August of '78.  She urged me to file a report with the BFRO, even though it's ""ancient history"" by now.

Whatever it was walked through the brush quite loudly.  We figured it was a bear and made noise and scared it away.  Later that night, however, we began to hear some sort of scream.  None of us knew what it was, but we all agreed it was like nothing we've ever heard.  It was very dark and we decided not to try and find out what the noise was, as it was quite some distance away.  Until recently, we still wondered what we heard, but then we listened to vocalizations on this website and heard the same sounds.  What we heard was very similar to the 1978 Snohomish County recording.

One night when we were all asleep the family dog started violently barking.  Everyone sprang to their feet to discover a large,hairy creature standing about 10ft. from our R.V.  It turned around and looked at the R.V. and started jogging off in a humanly way.  We were so amazed that nobody in the camper said a word until the next morning.  We went outside and there were huge footprints since it was damp and rainy.  We didn't get a ""good"" look at the animal but we still saw something that was hairy and very large.  The color was and still is unknown.  Thank you for your time.

Since we were in my Suburban I could tell very easily that what ever we were seeing was tall. I recall that my brother was so shocked he even jumped away from my side of the truck which is where the figure was. Even to this day the thought of what we saw makes my hair stand up.

I was standing on the east side appx. 20 ft from the bank looking for squirrel in cypress den trees. The creek was about 30 to 40 yards wide with banks 10 to 12 ft high. As the dogs drew closer I put a 12 ga 00 buckshot in my shotgun. I then saw what I thought was a person break through some bursh and slide down the bank almost to the water. It then crawled back up the bank and turned and looked my way. This creature had reddish brown hair all over its body about the length of a deer's hair. It stood appx. 6 to 6.5 feet tall. Due to its hair I could only make out its nose and eyes features. After a few seconds it turned north and jogged up the creek until it was out of sight. The next day I told my dad about this.

Turned around to walk back up the creek and heard a huge chrashing in the brush across from me and I stood still thinking it was a wild hog which has tried to attack me in the past. Started looking and couldn't get any really visible detail but saw what I am estimating as a 7 foot creature in the brush. I hollered at it and it backed up and completely dissapeared.

The sounds sound like something screeming. But kind of high pitched screems. My friend also thought he heard somthing throwing stuff around his treestand.

I also heard dogs barking above me, higher up the ridge. This time I realized it was probably not a human. This sound was a forceful, deliberate, high pitched reverberating scream/howl.

It was still dark out and I had my lights on, the creature was just at the end of where my lights hit. It didn't seem to be extremely tall, but what caught my eye was the huge muscles on its legs and arms. It didn't appear to have much of a neck, like the head was sitting on the shoulders. I could see that it was not wearing any clothes, but also did not see long hair either. I would estimate it to be between 6'-6'5"". It was a dark dirty black/grey color. It disappeared quickly into the cornfield. This all runs extremely close to the river. The area it came from always has multiple deer feeding and crossing the road.  I always drive slow and cautiously on this stretch of road.","Several hundred feet east of the South Fork of the Sangamon River on Rochester Road, between East Lake Drive and the village of Rochester.","Sangamon County","Illinois","Fall","Report 58238: Nighttime road crossing between Rochester and East Lake Drive",39.75318,-89.56226,"9/16/2017",58238,"Class A","dp061uyg01",89.6,77.6,66.6,64.4,66,14.4,0.87,0,0,NA,1016.9,"Clear conditions throughout the day.","Clear",NA,9.9,176.7,11.7,184

One evening several students were out there and a friend of mine asked me to drive him out there.  Around midnite we were heading back to campus, I was taking a curve and as I got into the corner I saw a large ape-like, human-like creature standing just off the pavement. I would say it was 7.5'-8' tall and 350-400 pounds.  I'm not sure of the color since it was dark. I would say it was dark brown, but the moonlight and limited visibility gave it's coat a whiteish sheen. The vehicle I was driving was a 'lifted' pickup truck.  I was able to see eye-to-eye with it. The creature appeared to be much taller than the vehicle, but it was either squatting slightly or hunched down a bit. It had very broad shoulders, much larger than anything I had ever seen. They were close to 3' across. I looked right into it's face and it's eyes were a deep black. They could have been brown, and appeared darker due to the lack of light.","This was out in an area close to Shoal Creek in Joplin, MO.","Newton County","Missouri","Fall","Report 27785: Nighttime roadside sighting by a motorist outside Joplin",37.03575,-94.52888,"6/22/2010",27785,"Class A","9ysf8ynhvk",94.9,85.4,75.4,71.6,64.5,15.6,0.37,0,0,NA,1015.3,"Clear conditions throughout the day.","Clear",NA,9.4,179.4,18.8,195

As I was going up the mountain, I rounded a corner and about 300 feet from me and maybe 400 feet front tintagel lane, a tall hairy creature, dark brown with some gray along the back shoulders, walking on two legs, crossed the road (which is wide enough for 2 cars to pass each other) in about 2 steps and then was in the woods. The hair on the back of my neck instantly stood up, and I was terrified. I had my 11 month old son in the back seat, and I drove to campus as quickly as I could. Several of my co-workers on that campus have had experiences as well.","Happened about 400 feet from Tintagel Lane in Whitmore California","Shasta County","California","Summer","Report 63078: Motorist daylight sighting between Redding and Lassen National Forest",40.64289,-121.8214,"9/4/2018",63078,"Class A","9r1r5yu3gx",97.8,80.5,64.4,52,41.8,0,0.83,0,0,NA,1008.3,"Clear conditions throughout the day.","Clear",8,8.7,162,11.8,169

What really caught my attention was the concentrated interest this cub bear was paying to my backpack in particular.

At 18 years of age I couldn't force my mind to accept what my eyes were telling me. I watched the baby bigfoot (approx. 4-1/2 ft. tall) walk away from me into the trees for probably a full minute in duration. It disappeared into the trees at a distance of approximately 200-250 yards from me. It's arms swung like a person and walked with a smooth gate, not at all like a chimp or gorilla.

We would wonder through the woods and play war around the scrub palms. One evening it was just getting dusk, we had finished playing in the woods and were hanging around the playground. When one of the other kids said he saw something moving in the woods. We all climbed the ladder to the slide, to see further into the woods. I could just make out a shape, it was large, grey or brown covered in hair. It was moving slowly through the scrub palms we had been playing in, moving away from us. We, being just kids, freaked out and ran home to tell our parents. Only to be shushed and told it was our imaginations.","The name of the trailer court was Twin Lakes Estates.

Back then it was mostly woods and I was going to see a neighbor at a slow jog, looked to my right and we were both surprised.  He was what I figure to be about 7 ft 6 in.  He had big dark round eyes, lots of hair and just stared at me till I took off.  No sound, he didn't come after me he just stared.

"1684","Alachua County, Florida, around 1985 We lived in the country, with thousands of wild acres around our five acre plot.  While walking on  our paved road in front of our house one morning, I saw a creature cross the road about 250 yards from me.  I am a trained psychologist with a specialty in ready body language and knowing human gait and movement.  This creature moved more like an ape than a human.  He crossed at the small bridge over a flowing creek, and crawled down the side of the bridge into the creek and disappeared.  I ran over and went into the creek, only about a foot deep, to see if I could catch up with him, but there was not a trace. The very strange thing is that he was covered with green material, and it looked like leaves or palm branches from the sable palm.  Have you ever heard of a bigfoot doing this to make himself less visible in the woods?","Near county road 237 and NW 156th Steet(or Ave? everything has been re-numbered for 911 addresses","Alachua County","Florida","Fall","Report 2566: College Psychology Teacher observes Bigfoot crossing road.

That is when I looked down and seen these huge foot prints that appeared to be barefoot. I took pictures. I wear an 8 1/2 women. These look to be about a 17. It was also off the trail which made me think that was even odder. I did hear stomping noise out there which I believe were wild boar in the distance. There was a time later that I smelled something nasty. I never saw anything but those prints freaked me out a little bit.","San Felasco Hammock Preserve State Park","Alachua County","Florida","Fall","Report 36682: Woman finds possible footprints during morning bike ride in San Felasco Preserve northwest of Gainesville",29.74815,-82.44075,"10/9/2012",36682,"Class B","djm3hp2rx3",74.4,70.5,67.4,66.4,87.2,99.1,0.81,0,0,NA,1017.7,"Cloudy skies throughout the day.","Overcast",NA,7.6,30.2,7.9,109

This is an area directly in the Wekiva River basin. As I started through the s turns I saw another car coming in the opposite direction, as that car passed a large animal stepped out from behind that car, I think he was crossing until he seen my truck, it then pivited, turned and went back into the wooded area. On the next morning on my way to work again I got a better look at it, still in the same series of turns, except this time coming out of the last one, I seen it take one step in part of my lane then on across the road and was gone. I was looking down towards the hood of my truck at this time and can tell you that whatever it was, was very large, its waist area was about 1 foot above my hood of my ford ranger pick up.","head n.on highway 441 from Orlando,then go east on st.rt.46, finally head back s on mt. plymouth rd.","Lake County","Florida","Summer",NA,NA,NA,NA,30267,"Class A",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,181
"1689","I was hunting on me and my neighbor's property it was right before daylight. I could hear something coming through the woods so I figured it was a deer as it got closer the sound sounded more like somebody walking through the woods. Finally I seen what it was it was a massive black figure had to be 7 or so feet tall it walked slowly and turned its head when it was walking, it stopped looked at me then it took off in massive strides. This animal had broad shoulders and it was walking on two feet. I was terrified but after the hunt that morning I went to where I seen it about 15 yards in buckbrush there was trees as big around as a PVC pipe pushed over. I don't know what I saw but it was nothing I've ever seen in my entire life and it made me think that there's something out there. I always heard of the legends but I never thought much about it until that day.","It was on my neighbor's property in the woods hunting","White County","Illinois","Fall",NA,NA,NA,NA,59058,"Class B",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,174
"1690","I was riding with a friend in the summer of 1974, on the back roads at night when we had to stop to relieve ourselves. First thing we noticed upon opening the car doors was the worst odor we had ever smelled. We walked to the back of the car and heard deep breathing. I looked toward the breathing sound up a 5 foot embankment. Standing still, next to a fence post was a dark tall wide figure facing me. I could clearly see the outline and it appeared dark with the skyline behind it. The fence post it was standing by only came up to its waist. Its shoulders raised and fell with its deep,loud breathing. That was enough for us, as this was about 20 feet away. We jumped in the car and sped away. We didn't talk for 10 miles or so down the road. When we did talk, we swore never to mention this to anyone else because we would have been ridiculed to no end.","This happened on the Mississippi River Road in Calhoun County, Illinois near the Reds Landing entrance.","Calhoun County","Illinois","Summer",NA,NA,NA,NA,39827,"Class B",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,170
